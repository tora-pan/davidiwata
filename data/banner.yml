  Raised by my Japanese stepfather, after never knowing my real father, I struggled with a turbulent childhood that included arson, burglary, and substance abuse. By 18, I had two DUIs and frequent stays in juvenile hall, eventually leading to time in nine different prisons. My life changed in 2001 when I found faith in Jesus, marking the start of my clean and sober journey. Now, Iâ€™m focused on living a positive life, giving back to those who supported me during my darkest times, and sharing my story to inspire others.
