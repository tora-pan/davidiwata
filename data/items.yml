  - name : "One"
    content : "Strap on your seatbelt, put on your helmet, grab your life vest, and pray. In this journey, you will
experience heavy turbulence as the writer draws you into this roller coaster of friendship, evil, love,
respect, redemption, passion, and pure blind faith. The story commences with a bus ride with 37
others only to stop in hell, otherwise known as being trapped by the gray walls of Folsom Prison. Yet,
Outlaw is innocent; he was framed in a drug deal gone wrong by the LAPD. Now he has 20 years to
learn the system and plan his escape.
Expect some profane language and situations at times, as this is not “Driving Miss Daisy.
” No, this tale
adds Red Bull to your Starbucks dark roast triple shot espresso paired with a nicotine buzz of
adrenaline while you skydive blindly into a cloud without a parachute.
You will find yourself emerged in the story and rooting for the Outlaw in pure “Rocky” fashion.

    content : "My husband and I personally know the author and this book is actually very true to life. Terrific read.
After reading this book, (there are more twists and turns than Carter has Liver pills), funny in spots, sad
in spots, suspense in spots. reads like a jig-saw puzzle, but the pieces ALL fit together. Tough book to
put down. Hard to find a good stopping place. Again, I believe this is book if more truth than fiction. A
TERRIFIC read!!!!! -- Jodie"
